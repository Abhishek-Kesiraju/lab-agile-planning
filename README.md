Lab5: Mimicked a Sprint Planning meeting ( Created Sprints in Zenhub, Added stories in product backlog to the sprint backlog after assigning the corresponding sprint           with story points )
Lab6: Mimicked an actual sprint, Assigned User stories from the sprint backlog to myself and moved them to In-progress -> Review/QA -> done pipeline in the Kanbanboard
